# The-Simon-Game
A Js experiment with JQuery to recreate the classic Simon Game!

## How to Play:
The game starts by pressing any key!
The next expected color to be clicked is flashed.

You can press any key to start.
Next it will show you a tile that you have to click on.

And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated.
Upon you clicke the  wrong one it will tell that you got it wrong and game is over!

So you can press any key to restart the game!
